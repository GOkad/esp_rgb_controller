# RGB Controller Web Interface

## Development Notes
- use `setTimeout(()=>location.reload(), 500);` to reload the page to view the changes in real time. **`Just don't forget to remvove it!`**
- Every page should include `<page_name>.min.html` with minimal chars for naming. `.min.html` file should be minified and added to the project in order to take minimal memory space
